This guide acts as developer reference for the Aventus Protocol which is an open blockchain ticketing standard. The aim of the Protocol is to deliver a digital assets-focused, blockchain-based protocol that revolutionises standardisation, trust and innovation across enterprises and supply chains by acting as a secure and independent backbone of interoperability and communication.

We do treat this documentation as a developer resource so some complexities remain particularly related to Solidity. Therefore, any language and instructional information included assumes an existing technical knowledge of interacting with Ethereum and the typical practices involved.
