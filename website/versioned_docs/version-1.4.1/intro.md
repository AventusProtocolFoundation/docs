These guides act as a developer reference for the Aventus Protocol, an open blockchain ticketing standard. The aim of the Protocol is to deliver a digital assets-focused, blockchain-based protocol that revolutionises standardisation, trust and innovation across enterprises and supply chains by acting as a secure and independent backbone of interoperability and communication.

This documentation is purely a developer resource and as such is pitched with some assumptions as to how familiar the intended audience is with some technical concepts. Because of this, some complexities do remain, particularly related to Solidity, so please seek further information in the relevant external documentation if something is unfamiliar and not covered here. Any language and instructional information included assumes an existing technical knowledge of interacting with Ethereum and the typical practices involved.

Please visit the [aventus.io](https://aventus.io/) website to learn more about the Protocol and how it can be used for management of events and tickets.

To begin with the Aventus Classic Protocol has been released to testnet and is ready for the open-source community to collaborate on and utilise. The main Protocol is still in development and will be released with full documentation in due course.

To learn a little more about Aventus Classic, click the button below to explore the Whitepaper, or alternatively dig straight into the [contract locations](/docs/classic-contracts) if you're ready to begin interacting with the Protocol.
